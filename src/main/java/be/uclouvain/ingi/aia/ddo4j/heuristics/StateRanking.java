 * A state ranking is used to order the states and decides the ones that are kept

 * In this context, a state ranking is nothing but an ordering on the states 
 * which is defined in the form of a comparator. The solvers and MDD should
 * interpret compare(a, b) > 0 as a should have an higher chance of being kept 
 * intact while b should have an higher chance of being merged.
